Following notes explain some limitations about the usage of the following documentation:

1. Some feature will not be available until the SMTP server is provided and configured.
2. The procedure refers to the 'Server administrator', only the user 'Admin' have this kind of permission.

## Copy a provisioned dashboard

Provisioned dashboards cannot be edited by a user. Editors or Admin users need to copy the dashboard in a folder with editor role assigned to the user.

Then two choice is available:

1. Click on `save` üíæ button. A dialog open informing that the dashboard can not be edited and shows the `json` to be copied. Once the `json` retrieved, add a new `Dashboards -> Import`, then the `json` can be loaded to initiate the new dashboard.

2. Click on the dashboard `settings` ‚öôÔ∏è, then `Save As...` and select the folder where copy the dashboard.
